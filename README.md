# DigitRecognition
Uses Keras and PyGame to build an Ai model that detects digits in real time. This model was trained using the Mnist data set.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/LMascher/DigitRecognition
```
```
cd DigitRecognition
```
```
python MnistIdentification
```

## Prerequisites

```
pip install keras
```
```
pip install tensorflow
```
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install opencv2
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Be sure to change the directory. When you start the program, it will train the model. Be sure to train as much as you can, to be as accurate as possible. 

## What I learned from this project:

 - How to use Keras
 - How to work with an Mnist data set
 - How to use PyGame
 - How to train an Ai model
